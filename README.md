# Zynthian Controller

[Zynthian] (http://zynthian.org) is an Open Synth Platform based in Raspberry Pi, Linux (Raspbian) and some Open Software Synthesizers.

This repository contains the stuff for building a MIDI-USB controller for the Zynthian Platform. The current design has 8 rotary encoders with led-ring controlled with an Arduino-like board (SparkFun ATmega32U4). The firmware allows to control upto 24 MIDI-CC parameters (3 layers: red, green, blue).
